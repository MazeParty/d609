Project: STEDI Human Balance Analytics
Landing Zone
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Use Glue Studio to ingest data from an S3 bucket

customer_landing_to_trusted.py, accelerometer_landing_to_trusted.py, and step_trainer_trusted.py Glue jobs have a node that connects to S3 bucket for customer, accelerometer, and step trainer landing zones.

Manually create a Glue Table using Glue Console from JSON data

SQL DDL scripts customer_landing.sql, accelerometer_landing.sql, and step_trainer_landing.sql include all of the JSON fields in the data input files and are appropriately typed (not everything is a string).

Use Athena to query the Landing Zone.

Include screenshots showing various queries run on Athena, along with their results:

Count of customer_landing: 956 rows
The customer_landing data contains multiple rows with a blank shareWithResearchAsOfDate.
Count of accelerometer_landing: 81273 rows
Count of step_trainer_landing: 28680 rows

Configure Glue Studio to dynamically update a Glue Table schema from JSON data

Glue Job Python code shows that the option to dynamically infer and update schema is enabled.

To do this, set the Create a table in the Data Catalog and, on subsequent runs, update the schema and add new partitions option to True.

Use Athena to query Trusted Glue Tables

Include screenshots showing various queries run on Athena, along with their results:

Count of customer_trusted: 482 rows
The resulting customer_trusted data has no rows where shareWithResearchAsOfDate is blank.
Count of accelerometer_trusted: 40981 rows
Count of step_trainer_trusted: 14460 rows
However, if you are following the stand-out suggestions, your row counts should be as follows:

Count of customer_trusted: 482 rows
The resulting customer_trusted data has no rows where shareWithResearchAsOfDate is blank.
Count of accelerometer_trusted: 32025 rows
Count of step_trainer_trusted: 14460 rows
Filter protected PII with Spark in Glue Jobs

customer_landing_to_trusted.py has a node that drops rows that do not have data in the sharedWithResearchAsOfDate column.

Hints:

Transform - SQL Query node often gives more consistent outputs than other node types.
Glue Jobs do not replace any file. Delete your S3 files and Athena table whenever you update your visual ETLs.
Join Privacy tables with Glue Jobs

accelerometer_landing_to_trusted.py has a node that inner joins the customer_trusted data with the accelerometer_landing data by emails. The produced table should have only columns from the accelerometer table.

Curated Zone
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Write a Glue Job to join trusted data

customer_trusted_to_curated.py has a node that inner joins the customer_trusted data with the accelerometer_trusted data by emails. The produced table should have only columns from the customer table.

Write a Glue Job to create curated data

step_trainer_trusted.py has a node that inner joins the step_trainer_landing data with the customer_curated data by serial numbers

machine_learning_curated.py has a node that inner joins the step_trainer_trusted data with the accelerometer_trusted data by sensor reading time and timestamps

Hints:

Data Source - S3 bucket node sometimes extracted incomplete data. Use the Data Source - Data Catalog node when that's the case.
Use the Data Preview feature with at least 500 rows to ensure the number of customer-curated rows is correct. Click "Start data preview session", then click the gear next to the "Filter" text box to update the number of rows
As before, the Transform - SQL Query node often gives more consistent outputs than any other node type. Tip - replace the JOIN node with it.
The step_trainer_trusted may take about 8 minutes to run.
Use Athena to query Curated Glue Tables

Include screenshots showing various queries run on Athena, along with their results:

Count of customer_curated: 482 rows
Count of machine_learning_curated: 43681 rows
However, if you are following the stand-out suggestions, your row counts should be as follows:

Count of customer_curated: 464 rows
Count of machine_learning_curated: 34437 rows
Hint: If you get unexpected results, consider using the Transform - SQL Query node rather than Glue-provided nodes.

Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out
Consider these additions to your project to make it stand out!

When creating the Glue Job to join data from the accelerometer readings and the customer table, filter out any readings that were prior to the research consent date. This will ensure consent was in place at the time that data was gathered. This helps in the case that in the future the customer revokes consent. We can be sure that the data we used for research was used when consent was in place for that particular data.
Anonymize the final curated table so that it is not subject to GDPR or other privacy regulations, in case a customer requests deletion of PII, we will not be in violation by retaining PII data --remove email, and any other personally identifying information up front.
